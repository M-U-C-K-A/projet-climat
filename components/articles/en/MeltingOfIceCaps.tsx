        <h2>Data on Ice Melting</h2>
        <p>
          The melting of ice caps has accelerated over the past decades. Current statistics show a significant reduction in ice volume, contributing to rising sea levels and disrupting marine ecosystems.
        </p>
        <h2>Consequences of Ice Melting</h2>
        <p>
          Environmental impacts include habitat loss for polar species and increased coastal erosion. Populations living in low-lying areas face heightened risks of flooding and displacement.
